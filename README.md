# tcr
In this project, a TCR (Thyristor-Controlled Reactor) is implemented on MATLAB, along with its output waveform and RMS values.

In the electric power transmission system, the TCR is a resistance that is connected in series through the bidirectional thyristor valve. The thyristor valve is phase-controlled and it gives the delivered reactive power that should be adjusted to meet the varying system condition.

The fundamental operation of TCR is the controlling of reactive power by firing angle control of the two thyristors in the configuration. Hence, here the controlling element is the thyristor while the controlled element is the reactor. Here the two inverse thyristors conduct alternatively for the two halves of the supply frequency.

During the operation, the input provided to the thyristor valve is delayed considering the reference for the same peak of the applied voltage of each supply half-input cycle.
